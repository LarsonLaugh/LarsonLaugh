During my research and spare time, I am passionate about writing software for multiple reasons:

- to implement mathematical algorithm to solve complex problems ([counterflow](https://github.com/LarsonLaugh/Counterfusion))
- to empower programmable hardware (Ardurio, Pi Pico) to build fun toy ([pidML](https://github.com/LarsonLaugh/pidML))
- to simulate a real physical system to assist the understanding of experimental obsesrvations ([toyband](https://github.com/LarsonLaugh/toyband)),
- to facilitate data handling and analysis ([SciData](https://github.com/LarsonLaugh/Scientific-data))
- to assist my research ([arXivEng](https://github.com/LarsonLaugh/arXivEng)), reading ([personalLib](https://github.com/LarsonLaugh/personalLibrary)) and stock investment (a JSON-based database)
